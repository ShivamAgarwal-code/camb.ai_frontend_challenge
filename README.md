# Project Description:
Create an audio pill player where files can be added individually on an audio track, shifted around in a timeline, and that changes the playback. 
Think about how iMovie works. Make it iMovie just for audio with the ability to create, upload, shift around multiple tracks and dynamically allow 
for playback on an ever-changing timeline in React on a browser. This challenge is designed to assess your ability to work with dynamic content and user interactions.

# Steps to run on local system:
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. Server will start at http://localhost:3000
